                        NetworkPrefix specifies the prefix length for every connected network.
                        This prefix length should be smaller than the CIDR prefix length.

                        For example, if the CIDR is 10.0.0.0/8 and the NetworkPrefix is 24,
                        then the connect subnet for each connected network will be 10.0.0.0/24.
                        A good practice is to set this to a value that ensures it contains more
                        than twice the number of maximum nodes planned to be deployed in the cluster.
                        Example; if you plan to deploy 10 nodes, set the NetworkPrefix to /27 (20+ IPs)
                        if you plan to deploy 100 nodes, set the NetworkPrefix to /24 (200+ IPs)
                        if you plan to deploy 1000 nodes, set the NetworkPrefix to /21 (2000+ IPs)
                        if you plan to deploy 5000 nodes, set the NetworkPrefix to /18 (10000+ IPs)
                        This field restricts the maximum number of nodes that can be deployed in the cluster
                        and hence its good to plan this value carefully along with the CIDR.
