                              The only allowed value is Persistent. When set, OVN Kubernetes assigned IP addresses will be persisted in an
                              `ipamclaims.k8s.cni.cncf.io` object. These IP addresses will be reused by other pods if requested.
                              Only supported when mode is `Enabled`.

                              Mode controls how much of the IP configuration will be managed by OVN.
                              `Enabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will apply IP configuration to the SDN infrastructure and it will also assign IPs
                              from the selected subnet to the individual pods.
                              `Disabled` means OVN-Kubernetes will only assign MAC addresses and provide layer 2 communication, letting users
                              configure IP addresses for the pods.
                              `Disabled` is only available for Secondary networks.
                              By disabling IPAM, any Kubernetes features that rely on selecting pods by IP will no longer function
                              (such as network policy, services, etc). Additionally, IP port security will also be disabled for interfaces attached to this network.

                          vlan.mode is the VLAN mode.
                            When "Access" is set, OVN-Kuberentes configures the network logical switch port in access mode.
                          vlan.access is the access VLAN configuration.
                          vlan.access.id is the VLAN ID (VID) to be set on the network logical switch port.
                          vlan is optional, when omitted the underlying network default VLAN will be used (usually `1`).
                          When set, OVN-Kubernetes will apply VLAN configuration to the SDN infra and to the connected pods.

                          vlan config is mutable.
                          When mutated, no additional action is required for changes to take effect.
                          Please note a transient network disruption may occur until settings are commited.
