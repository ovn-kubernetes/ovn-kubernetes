**Connecting Layer3 type networks together**

The below diagram shows the overlay part of the OVN Topology that OVN-Kubernetes
creates for 3 UDN networks (blue, green and yellow) across two nodes.

**Idea1: Add a new transit switch/router between the two ovn_cluster_routers of the networks**

When the UDNConnect CR gets created selecting these three networks, the controller
will make the following changes to the topology:
* Create a distributed colored-enterprise_interconnect-switch/router (basically a
  transit-switch/router type in OVN used for interconnection) with the `connectSubnet`
  value provided on the CR (default=192.168.0.0/10)
* Connect the colored-enterprise_interconnect-switch to the ovn_cluster_routerâ€™s
  of the blue, green and yellow networks on each node using remote patch ports and tunnelkeys

So in this idea it will be 1 router per connect API.

**Idea1.1 Add a new transit router between two ovn_cluster_routers of the networks and move the routes to the new router**

Ultimately Idea 1.1 is what we went with in the main proposal because its
the solution with no assymmetry

**Idea2: Connecting the ovn_cluster_routers directly**

When the UDNConnect CR gets created selecting these two networks, the controller
will make the following changes to the topology:
* Create a logical-router-port on `blue_blue.network_ovn_cluster_router` with an IP
  assigned from `connectSubnet`.
* Create a logical-router-port on `green_green.network_ovn_cluster_router` with an IP
  assigned from `connectSubnet`.
* Create a logical-router-port on `yellow_yellow.network_ovn_cluster_router` with an IP
  assigned from `connectSubnet`.
These three ports will have their `peer` field set as each other to allow for direct
connectivity.

The above diagram shows what happens when all 3 networks are connected together.

**Which idea to pick?**

| Topic       |    Idea1    |  Idea2      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Number of new IPs required for connectSubnet | N(nodes)*M(networks) | N(nodes)*M(networks) |
| Requires ovnkube-controller local IPAM for per node-network router      | YES       | YES       |
| Requires node-network router IP storage design (either annotations OR nodeNetworkCRD)      | YES       | YES       |
| Requires Centralized IPAM slicing per node   | YES        | NO - here given each node can re-use the same set of IPs, there is no need for centralized slicing - this is a huge advantage |
| Requires Centralized tunnel-ids allocation   | YES        | NO - this is a huge advantage |
| Reply is Symmetric | NO - but can be made symmetric with /24 routes if required | NO - replies will be assymmetric |
| Scalability of routes | /16 will be 1 route on each router per connected network | /16 will be 1 route on each router per connected network |
| Scalability of connections | Each router get's 1 additional port and the new switch will get M (number of networks) patch ports - so totally N*M patch ports | Point-to-point connections means all ovn_cluster_router's now have N*M patch ports |
| Dataplane churn caused for connect/disconnect | More isolated changes because adding and disconnecting a network is as simple as adding/removing the port only from that network's router and the central switch. | Direct R2R Connection - so disconnecting a network means adding/removing the port from each connected router towards this network. So removing a specific tenant network will involve touching routers of other tenant's networks. |
| Network being part of more than one connectAPI | Non-transitivity is automatically taken care of because there is no connection between the indirectly connected networks. |  Non-transitivity is taken care of because of the absence of routes on the router for the indirect connection to work. Any lingering stale routes could accidentally cause connectivity. |
| Extensibility for adding features | Better because adding a transit router or switch opens up adding newer features easily like having hierarchical hubs of connections | Direct Connection might put us in a bind with regards to how much topology change we could do in future |
| Throughput | Add's an extra hop | Better because its a direct connection |
| Networking model | Aligns with a vRouter/vSwitch model that users expect | Direct R2R Connection |
| Connecting mixed type networks | Aligns with a vRouter/vSwitch model that users expect - 1 transit switch per connectAPI | Direct R2R Connection |
| Accounting for missing topologies on some nodes | This can be accommodated but we'd need to use specific /24 routes.. What about L2? | This won't work |

**Idea3: Connect the transit switches of the two UDNs together (either using an interconnect switch/router in the middle OR directly using remote ports)**

This idea was dropped because:
* Additional burden for the user and new API change: Given each transit
  router today has the same 100.88/16 subnet that is not configurable in
  UDNs on day2, if we want to connect transit switches directly together,
  we would need support day2 changes by exposing this subnet via the API
  and to place an additional constraint of either having unique transit-subnets
  in each of the UDNs that have to be connected together. This being an internal
  implementation details seems like a hard requirement for the user to know and
  configure.
* Upgrades and disruption of traffic: Users using UserDefinedNetworks feature
  in the older versions will need to make the above disruptive change of transit
  switch subnets that will lead to traffic disruption.
* Transitivity of interconnections will happen here which is not desired: If
  we now wanted to connect yellow with green, yellow would end up being connected
  to blue automatically which is not desired, in the case where it's directly
  connecting with remote ports.

**Idea3.1: Using NATs**

To avoid having to change the transit switch subnet ranges, NAT to a particular
UDN IP before sending it into the interconnect router - but I assume we want to
preserve srcIPs of the pods. This would also add additional unwanted complexity
so this idea was also not pursued.

**Connecting Layer2 type networks together**

The below diagram shows the overlay part of the OVN Topology that OVN-Kubernetes
creates for 3 UDN networks (blue, green and yellow) across two nodes.
NOTE: The topology representation is that of the new upcoming Layer2 topology.
The dotted pieces in network colors represent the bits in design and not there yet.

[TBD] Check with OVN team transit router can indeed have routes and policies right?

**Connecting mixed type (layer3 and/or layer2) networks together**

The below diagram shows the overlay part of the OVN Topology that OVN-Kubernetes
creates for 3 UDN networks (blue(l3), green(l3) and yellow(l2)) across two nodes.
NOTE: The yellow topology representation is that of the new upcoming Layer2 topology.
The dotted pieces in network colors represent the bits in design and not there yet.
