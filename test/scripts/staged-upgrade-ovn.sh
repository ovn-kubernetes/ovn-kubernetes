# Staged OVN-Kubernetes upgrade for the kind cluster created by
# contrib/kind-helm.sh, modelled on how production GitOps upgrades work: a new
# chart version and image tag are handed to helm, and every component rolls
# according to its own update strategy. No pods are scaled down or deleted by
# hand, and nothing is re-provisioned. The only kind-specific step is loading
# the image into the nodes, which stands in for pulling it from a registry.
#
# The supported upgrade order is nodes first, then the control plane (see
# docs/design/upgrades.md). Two things are needed to test the half-upgraded
# cluster that order produces:
#  - hold back the control plane: `kubectl rollout pause` on the Deployment.
#    helm updates the pod template, the Deployment controller does not act on
#    it until `rollout resume`.
#  - hold back one node: before the upgrade, load the OLD image into that node
#    under the NEW image's tag. The DaemonSet rolls everywhere with the new
#    tag, but on that node the kubelet finds the tag already present
#    (imagePullPolicy IfNotPresent) and starts the old code. The next stage
#    loads the real new image into the node and recreates its pods. The
#    DaemonSet keeps its RollingUpdate strategy and its status is truthful, so
#    `rollout status` works unchanged; only the image ID differs per node.
#
# UPGRADE_STAGE:
#   all                 - single helm upgrade, everything rolls
#   nodes-first         - every node but one rolls to the new image, one node
#                         and the control plane stay on the old image
#   control-plane-last  - roll the held-back node, then resume the control plane
#
# Run e2e between the two stages to exercise both skews the order produces,
# new nodes against an old control plane and new nodes against an old node,
# and again after the second stage.
#
# Env:
#   OVN_IMAGE           image to upgrade to (default ovn-daemonset-fedora:pr)
#   KIND_CLUSTER_NAME   kind cluster to load the image into (default ovn)
#   HELM_RELEASE        helm release name used at install (default ovn-kubernetes)
#   HOLDBACK_NODE       node kept on the old image in nodes-first (default: the
#                       alphabetically last worker; empty to hold none back).
#                       Must be the same value in both stages.
#   PIN_OVS_NODE        keep ovs-node on OnDelete so OVS does not restart under a
#                       running ovnkube-node (default true, see below)
